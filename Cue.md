## Data Tracked
The Cue is an incredibly (potentially) device that tracks various pieces of data. There are five main modules that it advertises: Inflammation, Vitamin D, Fertility, Influenza, and Testosterone. In order to measure these different things, each module requires a different sample. One requires a blood sample, another require a swab from the inside of your nose, etc. Certain chemical levels are tracked in each of the samples in order to produce some results regarding your health.

## Knowledge Provided
The Cue is advertised as an EXTREMELY smart device. First, the core functionality is to report back to you the levels corresponding to each module you own, which is impressive enough. However, in addition to this, it also uses all of this data together in order to build a complex health profile for the user. It connects you directly in communication with your doctor so that you can easily and quickly express any concerns that are brought to your attention as a result of your data being gathered. In addition, the companion Cue mobile app looks at your current schedule. If, for example, it could benefit you to exercise a little bit, the Cue looks at your calendar for an opening in your schedule, and automatically suggest and creates a calendar event for you to go on a run. This knowledge that is provided is not only the levels of health in your body, but the course of action you should take in order to improve your health even further.

## Limitations
There is one MASSIVE limitation to the Cue. It has yet to be released. This device has been in the works for years, and its developers are terrible at communicating with its investors/future customers. [The Cue Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CueHealth/) contains many complaining reviews from pre-orderers who have no idea what is going on.
In addition, one other limitation is the fact that in order to track a certain one of the five “lifestyle indicators”, you need to purchase and own the associated module. This obviously can be remedied by just buying every module, but it is worth noting.

## Ethical Concerns
The ethical concerns of this device parallel the limitations exactly. The fact that the developers are so bad at communicating with its customers indicates that they can’t really be trusted, at least not completely. If the company can’t even tell the customer what they are doing with their money, how in the world can we trust them with our health data? From what I could find, the Cue development team didn’t really make any sort of data security statements anywhere, which is also not a good sign. Despite the fact that this product seems too good to be true, I would want to know a lot more information about what is going on behind the scenes before I could recommend this product to anyone.
