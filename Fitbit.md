## Data Tracked
I also had the pleasure of being able to personally use and test a Fitbit for an extended period of time. The version I had was the Charge (first generation). There was a special version of the Fitbit Charge called “Charge HR”, which also has the hardware necessary to monitor heart rate. My fitbit was mainly used to track my number of steps throughout the day. I would say a goal of 10,000 steps and do my best to reach it. Some days I would be about to go to bed and realized that I only needed a few more steps to hit my goal, so I would walk paces around my house in order to reach my goal. During these very intentional uses of my Fitbit, I found that the step tracking was very accurate.

## Knowledge Provided
The mobile app or web app (depending on what type of user you are) is where all the magic happens. Below is a picture summarizing the main knowledge that is provided to the user.

You can see that the most prominent data that is presented in the upper left is the “Step Activity”. It shows the user how many steps he or she performed over the course of the day, week, month, etc. It breaks the data up into hourly increments, showing the user which times of the time he or she was the most active.
In addition to the step data, the Fitbit app also takes data about the height of the user as well as data is gathered through calibration in order to tell the user how many miles they walked, how many calories they burned, and how many floors they have climbed based on their number of steps. In addition, the Fitbit app provides a leaderboard to the user which says which friends have had the most steps on the given day. This can serve as motivation for the user to try and get to the top. The last piece of knowledge the Fitbit provies to the user is the amount of time they slept every single night. In my opinion, this is the most impressive thing the Fitbit does. It is incredibly accurate, showing the user not only the number of hours they were asleep, but also which hours they were in deep REM sleep and which hours they are restless. The Fitbit takes the main parts of this knowledge (the steps, calories burned, and floors climbed) and sends it back to the wearable device on the users wrist. This can give the user easy access to their Fitbit knowledge at any point during their day.

## Limitations
Similar to the [Apple Health App](AppleHealthApp.md) and the [Apple Watch](AppleWatch.md), for certain features to be used, manual input is required. I didn’t talk about this above, but one of the things the Fitbit app allows is for your to track your diet. Obviously, your Fitbit cannot track the food you put into your mouth, so manual input is required. Finally, certain features (like the heart rate monitor) requires hardware that is only available in certain versions of the Fitbit (see the many types below).

## Ethical Concerns
Fitbit claims on their website that they pledge to never sell your data and make it clear what data they collect and how they use it. They also give a link to [this website](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0038-onguardonline), which they suggest visiting in order to seek advice on how to stay safe and protect your own data while you are offline. Overall, I would say Fitbit handles the data and their users very ethically.
