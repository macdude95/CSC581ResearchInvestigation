Theranos, the product as well as the company, is a very controversial topic. It is a miniature lab that promised so much early on, but ultimately fell into scandal after scandal as it seems like the promises they made early on weren’t actually true. Because of this, this blog past will not follow the normal structure. Instead, I am going to just talk in free form about the product, what it does, and the story that has emerged about it.

Theranos is a play on the words “therapy” and “diagnosis”. Their main product (that was promised) is a miniature laboratory (pictured above) that takes blood samples and provides back all sorts of useful information about the person the sample was taken from. However, their secrecy caused many people to be skeptical of their product they were producing. Investors invested over 700 million dollars into Theranos, a company that, at its peak, was worth 9 billion dollars.

The idea of this product is that testing blood would be a lot faster and a lot less blood would need to be extracted. Users would then have instant access to their results from their blood tests through their Theranos smartphone app without having to go through a doctor. 

There is one big problem with all of this. Their methods were never reviewed by medical experts, meaning that no one really knows if their product would really work in the way they promised. Allegations were made against Theranos, so people started demanding some explanation of their methods, but they remained secret to funding started decreasing.

It was Alleged that the tests that Theranos was performing was actually using machines that other companies made. Pretty much they weren’t actually making their own technology. They were simply using products that had already been released. In addition, their results actually were proven to be incredibly inaccurate. On top of all of this, their workers were incredibly under qualified and unlicensed employees who weren’t running the lab well at all. Federal prosecutors started conducting a criminal investigation about Theranos to see whether or not they were actually just lying to their investors.

The reasons this topic is so interesting actually turns out to be sort of unrelated to my research topic. It could be that media hyped up Theranos too early on and the company got ahead of themselves. Whatever the reason for this scandall, we can all agree that what happened with this company was truly a technological tragedy.
