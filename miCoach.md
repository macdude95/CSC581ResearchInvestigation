## Data Tracked
A few years back, Adidas started their “miCoach” line of products. The goal of this campaign was to create several smart products that could help customers of Adidas (specifically soccer players) elevate their game. I am going to be talking about two specifically: the Adidas f50 Adizero soccer cleats and the miCoach Smart Soccer Ball.
The cleats are relatively straight forward. There is a small insert that goes into the sole of the cleat. This insert tracks the soccer player as they play. Specifically, it keeps track of the various speeds that the player is running, the number of sprints they perform during a given workout, the total distance traveled, and the total amount of time spent exercising.
The Smart Soccer Ball tracks different data. It is meant to be used in the same way a normal soccer ball is used, but in addition it tracks data about the ball being kicked into a goal. This data includes the flight path of the ball: both the speed and the trajectory.

## Knowledge Provided
Both devices connect to a smart phone in order to transmit data. The miCoach mobile app represents all of the data being tracked. First, I’ll address the data from the cleats. The data of the playing being tracked during the workout is not only put into the app, but it is used to create a virtual avatar of the player that they can actually put into a virtual soccer game and play. Their own stats from real life play are used in order to create a character of the same stats in a video game (see the video advertisement I linked to above). I thought this was pretty clever.
The knowledge represented from the smart soccer ball is focused on shooting a soccer ball. It shows you which foot you kicked with, the path the ball took, and how fast the ball flew through the air.

## Limitations
Both of these devices are pretty limited. First, notice that the data tracked and knowledge represented from the soccer cleat is all about running: run speed, exercise duration, number of sprints, etc. None of these are actually soccer specific. The only thing specific about this product is the fact that you put it in a soccer cleat. You can not get any knowledge about your soccer specific skills nor can you use this in any other setting. (I guess technically you can wear you soccer cleats and run on pavement or in a gym, but from personal experience I can say that this is very dangerous and I don’t recommend it).
Second, the soccer ball actually requires a lot of setup. You need to charge the soccer ball, bring it out to the field, place it in the appropriate position to take the shot, select in the app that you are about to shoot the ball, select the foot you plan on shooting with, tap again on the screen when you are ready to kick, and finally kick the soccer ball. This is a lot of steps in order to gather knowledge from just one shot. In addition, this is nowhere near a game-like situation for a player. Most of the time during a soccer game, the ball is moving and so is the player. This stand-still knowledge that a user might get about their soccer shot therefore not actually that useful when it comes to a real soccer game.

## Ethical Concerns
Adidas has specified in their [Privacy Policy](https://www.adidas.com/us/what-is-the-privacy-policy.html) that they share some of the data from their users with other service providers. For example they share name, email, date of birth, and other personal information necessary to identify you. However, they explicitly state that they do not sell the user’s information and data tracked through their miCoach products. Personally, I would trust Adidas with my data. I don’t think there are any ethical concerns here.
