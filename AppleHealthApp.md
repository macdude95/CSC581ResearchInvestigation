## Data Tracked
The Apple Health app serves as the central hub for all things health data on the iPhone. It stores all of the movement data, dietary data, sleep data, data from third-party apps, and even heart rate data from the Apple Watch ([see my blog post on the Apple Watch](AppleWatch.md)). It categorizes the data it tracks into four categories: Activity, Mindfulness, Nutrition, and Sleep. Activity includes data points like walking/standing/sitting/exercise time. Some of this data can be tracked automatically and all of them can be input manually. The Activity data is very straightforward, and is very similar to the activity data tracked that I detail in my [Apple Watch blogpost](AppleWatch.md). The Mindfulness data is input often by using apps like “Calm,” (Image Below), where the user is prompted to have a minute or two of controlled breathing and meditation.

The Nutrition data can be either manually input or into from an outside app. This data obviously includes what the user has eaten and when. Finally, there is the Sleep data. This data can be automatically input from an app like the Fitbit app if the user has a fitbit, or it can be manually input.

## Knowledge Provided
The knowledge provided by the Health App can often feel overwhelming. The Activity information often is expressed in graphs and charts that show you how active you are. The Mindfulness information pretty much tells you how much time you have spent doing various mindfulness activities. The Nutrition knowledge is given to you by taking the food that you log and calculating the number of calories consumed. You can then easily track how many calories you consume over any period of time (day, week, month, etc). Finally, the Sleep knowledge is also represented in to form of charts and graphs. All of this knowledge is there for you to analyze and play with. You can modify/delete/add any specific data points you want to add in order to have a more accurate knowledge representation of your health.

## Limitations
As mentioned above, much of the data can only be input manually or through third party apps. This can be sort of annoying when it comes to inputting many data points. Another drawback is the fact that it is only available on the iPhone. There might be a way to access this data through your browser on your Apple account somehow, but it is not straightforward to do so. Finally, the knowledge representation can be a bit overwhelming with so many different data points to deal with. The graphs for the most part are pretty clear, but not all of the knowledge is represented in the form of a clear graph or chart.

## Ethical Concerns
Apple is known for protecting their users data very well, so users should not be concerned about Apple selling their Apple Health data to, for example, insurance companies to see how healthy people are before selling them insurance. All of your data as an Apple Watch user is just as secure as the rest of your Apple Id account. Overall, it is probably a good thing for every party when people use the Apple Health. Apple gets people more embedded into their ecosystem, and the user becomes more cognizant of their own health.
