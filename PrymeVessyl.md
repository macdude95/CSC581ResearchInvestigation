## Data Tracked
The Pryme Vessyl is an interesting product indeed. It is a smart water bottle that tracks your water intake. In fact, that is the only data it tracks. However, it does borrow data from your wearable smart device or smart phone in order to provide more meaningful data. Because that is really all the Pryme Vessyl tracks, this is a pretty short section.

## Knowledge Provided
The Pryme Vessyl using a unique marketing strategy (see link to YouTube video below the image of the device). They are all about making you feel like you are in peak condition to perform any task. As a result, they designed a state called “Pryme” which basically means that you are hydrated. This indicator can appear on your [Apple Watch](AppleWatch.md) (if you have one), on the companion app on your smartphone, or on the actual water bottle itself. It has a gauge alone the side of the water bottle that tells you your progress towards being hydrated or “Pryme”, and an LED indicator light that tells you whether or not you have reached this goal.

## Limitations
This device is extremely limited. First of all, the biggest drawback is that it only tracks the liquid you drink directly from the device itself. If you use a drinking fountain, go to a restaurant, etc. your data will not be tracked. In addition, the bottle has no way of telling if you put any other liquid besides water inside of it. Say, for example, you put something that is not very healthy for you into it like vodka. Your device will wrongly assume that you are hydrated and in “Pryme” condition, which wouldn’t be farther from the truth. Obviously, this is a silly example, but it just goes to show that if you don’t user this device precisely the way that it is intended, it will not work properly. Finally, this water bottle (as far as i could tell) does not tell you anything about overhydration. If a user gets over excited and drinks way too much water somehow, they could over hydrate and have some interesting health issues.

## Ethical Concerns
here is little to no information I can find about the security of the Pryme Vessyl. That alone makes me very concerned that your data tracked with this app is not safe. Sure, you might not think that it would be a big deal in the data about how much water you drink is sold, but you need to remember who it would be sold to. If it were sold to an insurance company, it could wrongly represent how much water you drink and your health in general. There are many reasons I would not recommend using the Pryme Vessyl, and privacy of your data is the biggest reason (besides the fact that at 60 dollars [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Mark-One-Vessyl-Personal-Hydration/dp/B01HMU687Y), it is grossly overpriced... that alone is an ethical concern).
