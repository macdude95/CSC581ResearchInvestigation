# A Survey of Self-Improvement Smart Devices
### A CSC 581 Research Investigation

In recent years, smart devices have been becoming more and more popular. The rise of the internet of things has caused many engineers to start thinking of new ways to fuse technology with devices we use everyday. As a result, all sorts of smart devices have been designed in order to help people improve various areas of their lives. These areas include diet, physical fitness, sleep, sports skills, etc. For this project, I am going to research the many self-improvement related smart devices that currently exist. For each device, I will be writing a blog post discussing the data it tracks, what knowledge it provides, and its limitations. In addition, I will discuss the ethical implications of each device including the privacy and security of the data that is being collected. By the end, my goal is to have a somewhat comprehensive overview of how modern smart devices help us improve our lives.

Below you will find links to various "blog post"-style entries, each focusing on a different device
