## Data Tracked
In order to get a more realistic understanding of the Pure Drive Play smart tennis racket, I got the chance to video chat with a tennis player I know who got the opportunity to use one for an extended period of time. He said that besides charging the device, you use it just like a normal tennis racket. It tracks data about your swing and how your racket is making contact with the ball. It uses measurements from the tension in the strings in the different parts of the racket face in order to give you a good understanding of your own play.

## Knowledge Provided
After a tennis session, the idea is that your smart Pure Drive Play tennis racket syncs with your iPhone, which has an app that presents knowledge to you about the types of shots you are hitting. First, the app categorizes the shots you do into one of four categories: backhands, forehands, serves, and smash hits. These are the four most common categories used in tennis to classify different ways and scenarios in which you hit the ball. On top of this, if gives you information about the spin you put on the ball. It tells you whether you hit it with topspin, slice (bottom spin), or flat (no spin). It even tells you have much power you used when hitting the ball.
In tennis, the player has two chances per point to get the serve in. Because of this, typically the first serve is much harder and hit in a different style than the often safer second serve. When you are taking a serve, the app, to some extent, is able to identify whether your serve is your first or your second. This can be very valuable to a player if he wants to make sure his two serves are done in the way he had planned. Below I have inserted a link to a video where a player is testing out hitting the ball in different ways in order to see how accurate this device really is. I was personally extremely impressed with the accuracy.

Finally, the app provides one more useful piece of data known as the “Pulse” (pictured in the image at the top of this blog post). This unique chart combines your technique, endurance, and power in order to provide an overall score for you as an athlete. If you want to compare you “Pulse” with your friends who also use this smart device, you are easily able to. The technique is calculated by looking at the types of ways you are hitting the ball (certain ways of hitting the ball are objectively better than others in most situations). Technique is also based on what part of the racket you hit the ball with. There are certain places on the racket face you would never want to hit the ball with, for example the lower part close to the neck of the racket (see image below). The power has to do with how hard you hit the ball, and endurance has to do with how well you keep up both your power and your technique as you get tired throughout a session of playing. All of this knowledge that is provided to you as a tennis player is extremely valuable.

## Limitations
While this device seems to do exactly what it is designed to do, it is important to keep in mind that this is not an attachment or an insert or anything like that. The Babolat Pure Drive Play is an entire tennis racket. Most players have a certain style or even a specific racket that are used to playing with. Playing with other types of rackets feels unnatural and might result in them missing certain shots. Also, according to some user reviews that I read, it seems like serious tennis players mostly view this as a novelty item. It can be useful, but no device could ever be as useful as a real life coach standing there critiquing your swing.

## Ethical Concerns
Reading through the [Babolat Privacy Policy](http://play.babolat.us/privacy-policy) gave me peace of mind. They explicitly say that while they do use the data from their customers to improve their experience with their products, they to no sell, rent, or lease any data about their customers to third parties. I would trust Babolat with my data… maybe even enough to pick up tennis and purchase a Pure Drive Play tennis racket.
